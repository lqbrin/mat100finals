	The Gullfoss (waterfalls) in Iceland have a height of 104 feet. A pebble is thrown upward from the top of the falls with an initial velocity of 25 feet per second. The height of the pebble after $t$ seconds is given by the equation $h=âˆ’16t^2+25t+104$. How long after the pebble is thrown will it be 52 feet from the ground? Round to the nearest tenth of a second.
