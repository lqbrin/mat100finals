{
	A contractor estimated that 20 square feet of window space will be allowed for every 210 square feet of floor space.  Using this estimate, how much window space will be allowed for 4200 square feet of floor space?
}
{
\begin{tabular}{l r}
	$\dfrac{x}{4200}=\dfrac{20}{210}$ or 
	$\dfrac{x}{20}=\dfrac{4200}{210}$ or 
	$\dfrac{20}{210}=\dfrac{x}{4200}$ & 2 pts to here\\
	$210x=84000$ & 3 pts to here\\
	$x=400$ square feet & 4 pts to here \\
	(3 pts for correct solution, but no units are given)
	\end{tabular}
