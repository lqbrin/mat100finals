{
	A company that manufactures bikes makes a daily profit, $P$, according to the equation $\displaystyle P(x)=-100x^2+5000x-55444$ where $P$ is measured in dollars and $x$ is the number of  mountain bikes made per day. Find the number of mountain bikes that must be made each day to produce a zero profit for the company. Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
